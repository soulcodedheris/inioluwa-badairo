### [Mind] When the Unconscious Meets Infinite Intelligence

What if clarity isn’t forced?  
What if it’s heard?

> “A word or an image is symbolic when it implies something more than its obvious and immediate meaning.” (Carl Jung, Man and His Symbols)

Symbols carry a “wide” meaning you can feel but never fully define. We make them without trying, especially in dreams. Let me step out for a moment and speak directly to you. Our tools widen the view, but attention is still limited. Most signals stay outside awareness until we invite them in. The rest lands underneath.

For example:
* Binoculars help you see farther. They do not show what you are not looking at.
* A dream gives you an image while you sleep. The image points beyond itself.

We also resist the unknown. Misoneism (the quiet fear of the new) makes us dismiss what doesn’t fit. So the unconscious speaks in symbols. To guide. To balance. To restore what we overplay.

Freud and Jung read dreams differently:
* Freud: repressed wishes; follow associations; uncover conflict.
* Jung: purposeful guidance; study form and symbol; a message in its own language.
* Both can help. Some dreams point to conflict. Others point to what we’re ignoring.

About Infinite Intelligence, as Napoleon Hill used the term: think of it as the same receptive channel you meet when you slow down and pay attention. You make room, you listen, and useful guidance shows up. Different language, same practice.

As I read Jung’s work, I keep one rule in view from Adler: learn from the past, do not live in it. Use what clarifies the next step.

Quick aside: I rarely remember my dreams (maybe one a month). If that’s you too, you’re fine. We’ll work with whatever signal shows up.

Here’s a simple way to practice this week.

1) Catch one symbol
* On waking, write one image from a dream. One line is enough.  
* If no dream: note one “offbeat” signal from your day: a sentence that stuck, an image you kept seeing, a thought you didn’t want.

2) Sit with it for five minutes
* Describe it plainly. No poetry.  
* Ask: What might this be trying to balance? What am I resisting because it’s new? Where am I over controlling?

3) Translate to one action
* If it hints at burden, put one task down.  
* If it points to neglect, give 10 minutes of care to that area.  
* If it invites courage, take the smallest possible step today.

4) Keep a short evening check
* Read your core goals out loud.  
* Note one clue you noticed.  
* One sentence: “Tomorrow, I’ll test this by ______.”

A quick decoder you can keep in your notes:
* Function: What is this trying to do for me (warn, balance, encourage)?
* Feeling: What emotion arrives first (not the explanation, just the feeling)?
* Fit: Where in my life does this belong right now?
* Fraction: What’s the smallest 24 hour experiment?

You don’t have to force meaning. Let it gather.  
It might be a fleeting image.  
A line you almost skipped.  
A quiet nudge that keeps returning.

**Notice what you usually ignore.**

Call it your unconscious, call it Infinite Intelligence; the practice is the same: listen.
