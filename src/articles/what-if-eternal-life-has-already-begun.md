*I met Stephen while trying to understand eternal life — and he showed me what it means to already be alive.*

Hey friend,

I didn't set out to write this.

I was just sitting with a question — one that felt small at first, but kept growing:

**What does it actually mean to have eternal life?**

Not in theory. Not in the distant future. But now.

What would it look like to live like eternal life has already started?

I've always heard the phrase "eternal life" used in spiritual language — usually tied to heaven, salvation, or life after death. But I read John 5:24 this morning, and it said something:

> "Whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life."

It doesn't say "will have."

It says **has**. Present tense. Already.

That bothered me a little.

Because if eternal life is something I already have… I'm not sure I've been living like it.

So I went looking, trying to understand. And somewhere in that search, I stumbled across a story I hadn't paid much attention to before.

His name was Stephen.

I'd heard of him in passing. But to be honest, I never really sat with his story. This time I did.

Stephen wasn't an apostle. He wasn't a public figure. He was selected to help distribute food — a background role that most people would ignore. But there was something about the way he carried himself. Scripture describes him as "full of faith, full of the Holy Spirit, full of grace and power." Not because he was dramatic, but because he was deeply rooted.

When conflict arose, he didn't defend himself with panic. He didn't try to protect his image. He just told the truth — clearly, calmly, even boldly. It was the kind of clarity that didn't feel like argument. It felt like presence.

The people watching said his face looked like that of an angel.

I sat with that detail for a while. Because I knew something:

**You can only look like that — calm, radiant, anchored — when you're not trying to survive.**

Stephen wasn't bargaining for his life. He wasn't performing. He was living from something deeper. And then this moment happened:

> "Stephen looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God."

Everywhere else in Scripture, Jesus is described as seated at the right hand of the Father. But for Stephen, He stood.

That's when it hit me.

**Maybe eternal life isn't a reward you get for dying well.**

**Maybe it's a posture you receive that lets you live well — now.**

Stephen wasn't powerful because he was brave.

He was powerful because he was already alive in a different way.

That one story showed me more about eternal life than all the theories I'd heard.

Because it wasn't just about heaven. It was about the way someone could move through suffering, accusation, and even death — without being unmade by it.

And I guess… that's what I want.

Not to be dramatic or impressive.

But to live from the kind of wholeness that doesn't need fear as a motivator.

To say what's true without needing everyone to agree.

To serve in small roles without shrinking.

To forgive even when there's no apology.

To rest without guilt.

To glow — not for attention, but from presence.

If that's what eternal life looks like now, I want to live like I already have it.

So no, I didn't come into this week with an answer.

Just a question.

And a story that changed how I see the question.

Now I'm starting to wonder:

How much of what I worry about comes from forgetting I'm already alive?

How many decisions are rooted in survival — not sonship?

Maybe eternal life doesn't start when I die.

Maybe it started the moment I believed — and I've just been invited to finally live like it.

I don't have conclusions yet. Just a growing sense that I've already crossed over — and that life now needs to reflect that.

Grace and clarity,

Heris
