I've been deep in thought lately, piecing together some big ideas that have been swirling in my head. For a while now, I've been soaking up Alfred Adler's and Jim Rohn's philosophies‚ÄîAdler with his focus on living in the moment and courage in the face of life's tasks, and Rohn with his "you attract success by who you become" mindset. Those two have been my anchors, shaping how I think about life and movement. They taught me presence and self-discipline.

Then I stumbled across Wallace Wattles' *The Science of Getting Rich*, and it threw me for a loop. Wattles comes in hot with this idea that my thoughts can shape my reality, and suddenly, I'm questioning everything I thought I knew.

At first, it felt like these guys were pulling me in opposite directions. Wattles had me picturing a big future‚Äîlike, close your eyes and see what you want, down to the details. I'd sit there imagining a life with more freedom, more impact, a life that feels true to me. But then Adler's voice would cut through, saying, "Hey, what about right now? You're missing what's in front of you." And Rohn's right there too, going, "Nice vision, but who are you becoming to make that real?"

I was torn. Was I supposed to just think my way to a better life, or actually get up and do something about it?

I spent a lot of time wrestling with that‚Äîflipping through pages, scribbling in my journal, letting it all simmer. But I'm not someone who stays confused for long. I dig. I reflect. I test. And eventually, it clicked.

**These ideas aren't at odds‚Äîthey're pieces of the same puzzle.** Wattles isn't telling me to daydream until the universe delivers. He's giving me a starting point‚Äîa mental GPS. Adler and Rohn are the ones telling me how to move toward that destination. It's not thoughts or action‚Äîit's both, working together in rhythm.

Here's how I'm mapping it now:

**Wattles is the dreamer.** He's got me imagining what I want with clarity‚Äîlike a map showing me where I'm headed.

**Adler keeps me grounded.** He reminds me that the real task is in the here and now. That freedom and meaning come from action, not abstraction.

**Rohn is the push.** He's the mirror. "Are you growing into someone who can handle that vision?" He's not about hype‚Äîhe's about habits.

And this isn't just theory for me anymore. I've been wanting to start sharing what I learn‚Äîthrough posts like this, or maybe even a full-on content series. I used to think you had to be some polished writer or expert to put your ideas out there. But Wattles would say: *See yourself doing it. Picture yourself typing, publishing, connecting with someone who gets it.*

Then Adler cuts in, like, "Cool. But don't get stuck in the image. Just write one sentence. Show up." Rohn? He's watching if I come back tomorrow.

It's like building a house:

- **Wattles** hands me the blueprint. Without that, I'm just swinging a hammer aimlessly.
- **Adler** keeps me focused on the nail I'm hammering right now. Nail by nail, step by step.
- **Rohn** checks if I'm building muscle and endurance. The daily reps of becoming.

And here's the real kicker: I'm not just doing this for me. As someone who thinks in systems and sees patterns, I can't help but want to connect these dots for others too. Maybe it's the Adlerian in me‚Äîalways wanting to contribute, to serve. Maybe it's that sense of purpose I've been nurturing quietly, even when I didn't have the words for it.

I want what I share to feel like a conversation‚Äînot a lecture. I'm not some guru on a hill. I'm a guy figuring it out in real time, dancing between big dreams and grounded actions. And if my process helps even one person feel less alone in their wrestling match between vision and reality, then it's already worth it.

So no, I don't have to choose between dreaming big and staying present. I don't have to silence one voice to hear another. They're a trio, playing different instruments in the same symphony.

If you're feeling torn like I was, try this:

**Dream it with Wattles. Do it with Adler. Grow into it with Rohn.**

Don't pick a side. Let them play off each other.

This is the dance. This is life.

**TL;DR:** Adler and Rohn were my foundation‚Äîpresent action and personal growth. Wattles came in and added vision. Turns out, they're not contradicting each other‚Äîthey're collaborating. Dream big. Act now. Grow steady. This balance is inspiring me to start sharing what I learn, one post at a time. Let's dance.
