*She wasn't in the room. But her dignity still mattered.*

Today, while standing at the library cloakroom, a friend and I found ourselves discussing a classmate. As our conversation unfolded, he repeatedly mentioned her name ‚Äî casually, without much thought about who might be nearby or how those words might travel.

I felt a tug inside me ‚Äî not of fear or hesitation, but of deep respect. I asked him, more than once, to stop saying her name. This wasn't about silencing conversation or policing speech. It was about protecting dignity ‚Äî a principle Alfred Adler emphasized through his concept of social interest, the idea that true courage involves caring for others' well-being, even when they're not present.

In today's hyperconnected world, words carry more weight than ever. They ripple beyond our immediate circle and can shape reputations in ways we don't always foresee. To practice courage is not just to speak boldly, but sometimes to hold back, to choose restraint in defense of respect.

This experience reminded me that leadership often lives in quiet moments ‚Äî the ones where we make ethical choices not for applause, but because it's right. This is the kind of courage I want to cultivate daily.
