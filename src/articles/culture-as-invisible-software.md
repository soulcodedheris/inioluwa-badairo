*The unseen code beneath every product: culture, mindset, meaning.*

I read something that completely went over my head. It was from a book titled *Entrepreneurial Spirits* by Poly I. Emenike. In one of the chapters, he referenced a cultural theorist I hadn't heard of before: Geert Hofstede, known for his work on how culture shapes human behavior and organizations.

Dr. Emenike cited about two paragraphs from his co-authored book *Culture and Organizations*:

> "The nation system was only introduced worldwide in the mid-twentieth century. It followed the colonial system that had developed during the preceding three centuries. In this colonial period the technologically advanced countries of western Europe divided among themselves virtually all territories of the globe that were not held by another strong political power... In Africa in particular, most national borders correspond to the logic of the colonial power rather than to the cultural dividing lines of the local populations." (Hofstede, p. 18)

> "Different countries have different institutions: governments, laws and legal systems, associations, enterprises, religious communities, school systems, family structures. Some people, including quite a few sociologists and economists, believe these are the true reasons for differences in thinking, feeling, and acting between countries. If we can explain such differences by institutions that are clearly visible, do we really need to speculate about the culture as invisible mental programs?" (Hofstede, p. 19)

At first, I didn't fully grasp what this meant, so I reread it and still, it felt dense, like there was something crucial there, but just outside my reach. So I got curious. I snapped a picture of the page, used Gemini to extract the text, then brought it into ChatGPT. That's when the pieces started to come together. ChatGPT broke it down for me. And suddenly, I was seeing more than text. I began to relate it to code. Cultural code. And a completely new way of thinking about product design began to unfold.

When Hofstede speaks of "culture as invisible mental programs," he is inviting us to look beneath the surface. It is not just about visible structures like laws or borders. It is about the cognitive operating systems people inherit. The expectations, fears, values, and reactions they carry into every interaction, including digital ones.

**For creators building digital products in post-colonial societies like Nigeria, this distinction is not just academic. It is existential.**

The nation-state borders that frame our identities were not drawn with culture in mind. They were drawn with power in mind. What this means is that the default systems we inherit (from government to education to religion to entrepreneurship) are often mismatched with our actual cultural fabric. The result? A kind of inherited schizophrenia. We run our lives on foreign assumptions, foreign UX patterns, and foreign measurements of success. And sometimes, we don't even notice it.

So, what happens when you try to build digital tools on top of this mismatched foundation?

You get platforms that feel off. Tools that look slick but do not stick. Apps that win awards abroad but get ignored at home. These tools were designed for users who exist only in theory, not in the lived complexity of Nigerian or African reality.

This is where Hofstede becomes urgent.

**As a digital builder, you are not just writing code. You are writing software for minds shaped by invisible cultural scripts. If you do not decode those scripts, you will default to the West's.**

That is why digital ethnography (a term I literally just learned today) is not optional. It is foundational.

*P.S. Digital ethnography means studying how people interact with technology through the lens of culture.*

Before you design a budgeting app, ask: How do people around me really perceive money? Is it linear or cyclical? Sacred or practical? Personal or communal?

Before you build an educational platform, ask: What does authority mean in my culture? Who is trusted, and who is ignored? What is the role of shame, praise, and community visibility?

Before you design a feedback system or comment section, ask: How do people really express disagreement? Is open dissent welcomed, or does it signal disrespect?

**This is not just cultural curiosity. It is UX engineering at the soul level.**

Because if culture is the software of the mind, then your product is only as useful as it is culturally compatible.

And this is the discipline I am committing to.

Not just building useful tools. But designing culturally literate, psychologically wise, soul-aligned systems that restore agency, honor identity, and serve local patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting.

**This is the real work.**

Still learning, still digging.

As I write this, I have downloaded a few YouTube videos on digital ethnography, behavioral design, storytelling, and user psychology just to deepen my grasp of how all this shows up in product building. I'm still connecting the dots, still curious. This isn't just theory for me: it's a living question.

If you're building anything meant to serve real people, especially from culturally rich, underrepresented contexts, culture isn't just a nice-to-have. It's the software of the mind. And understanding that software might just be one of the most soulful things we can do as builders. Because maybe building soulful tools starts with being brave enough to unlearn.
