*A note on respect from an Adlerian heart.*

*Inioluwa Badairo 🍁*  
*June 09, 2025*

This morning, I've been sitting with a profound lesson from *The Courage to Be Happy* — the thoughtful sequel to *The Courage to Be Disliked* — a book that's quietly reshaping how I see respect and connection.

Adler defines respect not as admiration, not as pity, and not as fixing — but as the courage to see people as they truly are.

Not who I want them to be.

Not who they could be.

Just… who they are right now.

That gave me pause to reflect.

Because I'm someone who's now trying to see potential. I often want to help. To guide. To improve.

However, Adler offers a different perspective:

*Helping someone doesn't mean improving them.*

*It means walking beside them — as equals — trusting that they already have what they need inside.*

> "The moment I think someone needs my help to become worthy, I've already disrespected them."

## What confused me — and what I've come to understand

I've been intentionally trying to add social interest in my life — that Adlerian spirit of community, encouragement, and growth.

But when Adler says, "Don't help even if you can," I got confused.

Wasn't social interest about helping others? About improving the world around me?

The truth is, social interest is not about fixing people. It's about presence.

It's about living with others side by side, without superiority or control.

Helping without controlling. Encouraging without pressure.

**Respect says:**

*"You're already enough. I'll grow with you — not above you."*

## What this means for me — and maybe for you too

I don't have to control anyone.

I don't need to judge someone to feel wise.

I don't have to fix people to prove I care.

Respect is quiet. It's calm.

It trusts that the other person is whole — even in their pain.

## A note for my developer self

I want clean systems. Clear UI. Perfect structure.

But humans aren't systems. We're messy, emotional, and free.

So I'm asking myself more often:

*Am I seeing people — or trying to shape them?*

## A journal prompt (if you want one)

Where in my life am I trying to fix instead of see?

How would it feel to just… respect the process?

No grand lesson today. Just a quiet one:

**Respect isn't about being nice.**

**It's about being honest — and brave enough to let others be.**

Thanks for reading.
