*A Reflection on Faith, Purpose, and Wanting More*

*Inioluwa Badairo 🍁*  
*May 29, 2025*

This started with a quote I came across. It said something like:

> "The universe wants you to be rich. God wants you to have everything you want, because He can express more of Himself through you when you do."

It sounded inspiring. But I didn't want to accept it just because it felt good. So I started digging, asking questions, and even had some back-and-forth with a friend who helps me think through stuff. Together, we looked into the Bible, psychology, and what really matters.

## What We Found in Scripture

Stories came up about Abraham, Solomon, and Job—people who were blessed with wealth. But their wealth wasn't just for comfort; it came with responsibility and purpose.

Jesus also warned against greed and said life isn't about having more things.

So, maybe God blesses sometimes. But it's not about having a lot. It's about who I become and what I do with what I have.

## What Psychology Helped Me Understand

Alfred Adler talked about how people want to grow by being useful to others. It's not just about me getting more. It's about how what I have can help me serve, love, and belong.

That made sense to me. Wanting more isn't wrong. But it only matters if it helps me become better and help others.

## What I Think Now

Maybe the question isn't, "Does God want me to be rich?"

Maybe it's, "If I ever am, what would God want me to do with it?"

If I have more, I want to carry it well. If I don't, I still want to live fully.

## What I'm Holding On To

- I'm meant to grow
- I want to be useful, not just comfortable
- More is only good if it leads to more love and service
- God works through people, and I want to be open to that

I'm not trying to be flashy. I want to grow steady and deep.

I'm young, still figuring this out. Still learning how to live in line with what I believe.

I don't want riches just to say I got them. I want to become someone worthy of whatever comes my way.

As an Adlerian, I see life as a journey of growth and usefulness. This reflection is part of how I'm learning to live that out—and I'm glad to share it with anyone who's on the same path.

Before I close, I want to say this clearly:

**God may desire abundance for me—not for its own sake, but as a means to express Himself more fully through my life. Abundance is a tool, not a goal—and true success lies in how I use it to serve, grow, and uplift others.**

This reflection came from reading a book called *The Science of Getting Rich* by Wallace Wattles. It pushed me to ask bigger questions about faith, purpose, and what it really means to have "more." It's not about chasing wealth for its own sake. It's about what having more allows me to do with who I am.
