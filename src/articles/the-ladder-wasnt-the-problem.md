**Why most of us don't need to grind harder — just aim better.**

There's this wild image Alfred Adler once gave.

Imagine you're sitting in a classroom. Your teacher suddenly calls for a ladder, climbs up, and perches awkwardly on top of the blackboard.

Everyone's confused. Maybe laughing.

"Dude's lost it."

"Bro thinks he's in Cirque du Soleil."

But Adler explains:

*He wants to sit on the blackboard because he feels inferior unless he is physically higher than other people. He only feels secure if he can look down on his class.*

Suddenly, the absurd behavior makes sense. The guy's not crazy. He just has a very specific (if flawed) goal — to feel superior. The ladder wasn't random. It was strategic.

And here's the punchline:

If you took away the ladder, he'd grab a chair.

Take the chair, he'd jump.

**The man doesn't need new tools — he needs a new goal.**

## The Realest Part? That's Us Too.

Adler's point wasn't just about theatrics. It was about life.

About me.

About you.

We're often hustling — not because we're broken, lazy, or irrational — but because we're chasing a goal that's quietly rooted in fear, ego, or lack.

Maybe we don't feel worthy unless we're productive.

Maybe we post endlessly just to stay visible.

Maybe we grind, not because we're called to build — but because we're scared of being forgotten.

And it's easy to shame ourselves:

> "You're doing too much."
> 
> "You're being dramatic."
> 
> "You're just overthinking."

But Adler would say: **nah.**

You're not "doing too much."

You're just aiming at the wrong thing.

## 🪜 My Ladder Moment

I'll be real.

There were times I caught myself forcing progress. Climbing metaphorical ladders — not because I loved the view, but because I thought I had to.

To matter.

To "catch up."

To feel like I earned my spot.

But every time I got higher, it felt... emptier.

That's when Adler's metaphor smacked me hard.

I didn't need to grind differently.

**I needed to believe differently.**

## A Shift in Goal = A Shift in Grind

Once you change your story, you stop chasing empty validation.

Once you update your goal, your strategy auto-updates.

It's not about ditching your ambition — it's about realigning your why.

Now I build slower but deeper.

With clarity.

With flow.

With breath in my code.

Because the real flex isn't how fast you climbed.

**It's whether what you were climbing towards even deserved you.**
