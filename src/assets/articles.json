    "html": "<html><head></head><body><p><em>Inioluwa Badairo üçÅ</em><br>\n<em>August 16, 2025</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-this-matters\">Why this matters</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Indeed, we all endure hardships more willingly for virtue than for vice. For hard work brings a good, and when the toil passes, the good remains; but pleasure is short-lived and, when it passes, it leaves repentance in its place.\" ‚Äî Musonius Rufus</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What looks good now often looks different later. That is the essence of second order thinking. Every action has consequences you see immediately and consequences you only meet later. The first are loud. The second are quiet, but they run deeper.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the economic sphere, an act, a habit, an institution, a law, produces not only one effect, but a series of effects. Of these effects, the first alone is immediate; it appears simultaneously with its cause, it is seen. The other effects emerge only subsequently; they are not seen. There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen.\" ‚Äî Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat (the opening of What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen (1850))</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is the trap. Human nature tilts toward the short term. We chase comfort and avoid effort. Yet the things that shape health, wealth, and character rarely come from what is easy now. They come from choosing friction now so strength compounds later.</p>\n<p>To think in second order terms is more than a clever strategy. It is a discipline, even a moral duty. Live with eyes open to the unseen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"first-order-vs-second-order\">First order vs second order</h2>\n<p><strong>First order thinking</strong>: linear; one step, one solution; feels good in the moment</p>\n<p><strong>Second order thinking</strong>: systemic; sees ripples, interactions, and compounding effects; endures wisely</p>\n<p>History is full of first order traps. A government arms a rebel group to topple a regime. The first order result looks clean: problem solved. Zoom out a few years, and the same rebels become a new enemy. Short term gain. Long term chaos.</p>\n<p>Sociologist Robert K. Merton called this blindness the \"imperious immediacy of interest\". We want what we want now so much that we ignore what follows, even when the danger is obvious.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-simplest-tool-and-then-what\">The simplest tool: \"And then what?\"</h2>\n<p>It sounds naive, but it cuts through illusions better than complex frameworks.</p>\n<p>This is first principles thinking in practice: break things down to their roots instead of tinkering at the surface. Most people shift blocks around. The first principles thinker dismantles the house, studies the bricks, and rebuilds something new.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-quick-example-social-media\">A quick example: social media</h2>\n<p>First order effect: endless entertainment, quick laughs, a sense of connection. Simple.</p>\n<p><strong>Then what</strong>: the brain adapts to the dopamine loop; compulsive scrolling</p>\n<p><strong>Then what</strong>: anxiety, shorter attention spans, comparison driven depression, a warped sense of reality</p>\n<p>What began as \"let me unwind\" becomes \"my behavior, mood, and worldview are being reshaped without my permission\".</p>\n<p>Every invention solves one problem and, if left unquestioned, creates another.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-body-example-food-and-focus\">A body example: food and focus</h2>\n<p>Have you noticed how your mind seems to dim after a heavy meal, as if someone pulled the plug on your focus? I blamed sluggish afternoons on discipline, not biology.</p>\n<p>When I overate, my vagus nerve (the bridge between gut and brain) sent its message upward to the brain: \"Ini just did a stupid thing, can you please slow him down, we need energy for digestion\". My sharpness dulled, motivation dropped, and hours were lost to mental haze. A harmless first order choice (\"enjoy the food\") was taxing my mind and my work. Every plate too heavy was a small tax that added up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-simple-playbook\">A simple playbook</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Decision</li>\n<li>First order consequence</li>\n<li>Second order consequence</li>\n<li>Third order ripple</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pause and map it out.</p>\n<p>\"I scroll for ten minutes.\" <strong>Then what</strong>: lost focus</p>\n<p><em>(P.S - We all have 24 hours a day, so I can't compete on time. Focus? Focus is a force multiplier for our time. I can compete on focus instead.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Then what</strong>: a derailed evening</p>\n<p><strong>Then what</strong>: a weaker trust in myself</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the decision is no longer trivial. It is identity on the line in a small act.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing\">Closing</h2>\n<p>This is not easy. It takes discipline to say a harder \"no\" now to protect a better \"yes\" later. That is the path from being a reactor to becoming a designer.</p>\n<p>Second order thinkers accept short term discomfort as the down payment for long term power. They are not just managing decisions, they are shaping identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Notice what is quiet and choose for your future self.</strong></p>\n</body></html>",

We make them without trying, especially in dreams. Let me step out for a moment and speak directly to you. Our tools widen the view, but attention is still limited. Most signals stay outside awareness until we invite them in. The rest lands underneath.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>Binoculars help you see farther. They do not show what you are not looking at.</p>\n<p>A dream gives you an image while you sleep. The image points beyond itself.</p>\n<p>We also resist the unknown. Misoneism (the quiet fear of the new) makes us dismiss what doesn't fit. So the unconscious speaks in symbols. To guide. To balance. To restore what we overplay.</p>\n<p>Freud and Jung read dreams differently:</p>\n<p>Freud: repressed wishes; follow associations; uncover conflict.</p>\n<p>Jung: purposeful guidance; study form and symbol; a message in its own language.</p>\n<p>Both can help. Some dreams point to conflict. Others point to what we're ignoring.</p>\n<p>About Infinite Intelligence, as Napoleon Hill used the term: think of it as the same receptive channel you meet when you slow down and pay attention. You make room, you listen, and useful guidance shows up. Different language, same practice.</p>\n<p>As I read Jung's work, I keep one rule in view from Adler: learn from the past, do not live in it. Use what clarifies the next step.</p>\n<p>Quick aside: I rarely remember my dreams (maybe one a month). If that's you too, you're fine. We'll work with whatever signal shows up.</p>\n<p>Here's a simple way to practice this week.</p>\n<p><strong>Catch one symbol</strong></p>\n<p>On waking, write one image from a dream. One line is enough.</p>\n<p>If no dream: note one \"offbeat\" signal from your day: a sentence that stuck, an image you kept seeing, a thought you didn't want.</p>\n<p><strong>Sit with it for five minutes</strong></p>\n<p>Describe it plainly. No poetry.</p>\n<p>Ask: What might this be trying to balance? What am I resisting because it's new? Where am I over controlling?</p>\n<p><strong>Translate to one action</strong></p>\n<p>If it hints at burden, put one task down.</p>\n<p>If it points to neglect, give 10 minutes of care to that area.</p>\n<p>If it invites courage, take the smallest possible step today.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep a short evening check</strong></p>\n<p>Read your core goals out loud.</p>\n<p>Note one clue you noticed.</p>\n<p>One sentence: \"Tomorrow, I'll test this by ______.\"</p>\n<p>A quick decoder you can keep in your notes:</p>\n<p>Function: What is this trying to do for me (warn, balance, encourage)?</p>\n<p>Feeling: What emotion arrives first (not the explanation, just the feeling)?</p>\n<p>Fit: Where in my life does this belong right now?</p>\n<p>Fraction: What's the smallest 24 hour experiment?</p>\n<p>You don't have to force meaning. Let it gather.</p>\n<p>It might be a fleeting image.</p>\n<p>A line you almost skipped.</p>\n<p>A quiet nudge that keeps returning.</p>\n<p><strong>Notice what you usually ignore.</strong></p>\n<p>Call it your unconscious, call it Infinite Intelligence; the practice is the same: listen.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "html": "<html><head></head><body><p><em>The unseen code beneath every product: culture, mindset, meaning.</em></p>\n<p><em>Inioluwa Badairo üçÅ</em><br>\n<em>July 31, 2025</em></p>\n<p>I read something that completely went over my head. It was from a book titled <em>Entrepreneurial Spirits</em> by Poly I. Emenike. In one of the chapters, he referenced a cultural theorist I hadn't heard of before: Geert Hofstede, known for his work on how culture shapes human behavior and organizations.</p>\n<p>Dr. Emenike cited about two paragraphs from his co-authored book <em>Culture and Organizations</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The nation system was only introduced worldwide in the mid-twentieth century. It followed the colonial system that had developed during the preceding three centuries. In this colonial period the technologically advanced countries of western Europe divided among themselves virtually all territories of the globe that were not held by another strong political power... In Africa in particular, most national borders correspond to the logic of the colonial power rather than to the cultural dividing lines of the local populations.\" (Hofstede, p. 18)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Different countries have different institutions: governments, laws and legal systems, associations, enterprises, religious communities, school systems, family structures. Some people, including quite a few sociologists and economists, believe these are the true reasons for differences in thinking, feeling, and acting between countries. If we can explain such differences by institutions that are clearly visible, do we really need to speculate about the culture as invisible mental programs?\" (Hofstede, p. 19)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first, I didn't fully grasp what this meant, so I reread it and still, it felt dense, like there was something crucial there, but just outside my reach. So I got curious. I snapped a picture of the page, used Gemini to extract the text, then brought it into ChatGPT. That's when the pieces started to come together. ChatGPT broke it down for me. And suddenly, I was seeing more than text. I began to relate it to code. Cultural code. And a completely new way of thinking about product design began to unfold.</p>\n<p>When Hofstede speaks of \"culture as invisible mental programs,\" he is inviting us to look beneath the surface. It is not just about visible structures like laws or borders. It is about the cognitive operating systems people inherit. The expectations, fears, values, and reactions they carry into every interaction, including digital ones.</p>\n<p><strong>For creators building digital products in post-colonial societies like Nigeria, this distinction is not just academic. It is existential.</strong></p>\n<p>The nation-state borders that frame our identities were not drawn with culture in mind. They were drawn with power in mind. What this means is that the default systems we inherit (from government to education to religion to entrepreneurship) are often mismatched with our actual cultural fabric. The result? A kind of inherited schizophrenia. We run our lives on foreign assumptions, foreign UX patterns, and foreign measurements of success. And sometimes, we don't even notice it.</p>\n<p>So, what happens when you try to build digital tools on top of this mismatched foundation?</p>\n<p>You get platforms that feel off. Tools that look slick but do not stick. Apps that win awards abroad but get ignored at home. These tools were designed for users who exist only in theory, not in the lived complexity of Nigerian or African reality.</p>\n<p>This is where Hofstede becomes urgent.</p>\n<p><strong>As a digital builder, you are not just writing code. You are writing software for minds shaped by invisible cultural scripts. If you do not decode those scripts, you will default to the West's.</strong></p>\n<p>That is why digital ethnography (a term I literally just learned today) is not optional. It is foundational.</p>\n<p><em>P.S. Digital ethnography means studying how people interact with technology through the lens of culture.</em></p>\n<p>Before you design a budgeting app, ask: How do people around me really perceive money? Is it linear or cyclical? Sacred or practical? Personal or communal?</p>\n<p>Before you build an educational platform, ask: What does authority mean in my culture? Who is trusted, and who is ignored? What is the role of shame, praise, and community visibility?</p>\n<p>Before you design a feedback system or comment section, ask: How do people really express disagreement? Is open dissent welcomed, or does it signal disrespect?</p>\n<p><strong>This is not just cultural curiosity. It is UX engineering at the soul level.</strong></p>\n<p>Because if culture is the software of the mind, then your product is only as useful as it is culturally compatible.</p>\n<p>And this is the discipline I am committing to.</p>\n<p>Not just building useful tools. But designing culturally literate, psychologically wise, soul-aligned systems that restore agency, honor identity, and serve local patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting.</p>\n<p><strong>This is the real work.</strong></p>\n<p>Still learning, still digging.</p>\n<p>As I write this, I have downloaded a few YouTube videos on digital ethnography, behavioral design, storytelling, and user psychology just to deepen my grasp of how all this shows up in product building. I'm still connecting the dots, still curious. This isn't just theory for me: it's a living question.</p>\n<p>If you're building anything meant to serve real people, especially from culturally rich, underrepresented contexts, culture isn't just a nice-to-have. It's the software of the mind. And understanding that software might just be one of the most soulful things we can do as builders. Because maybe building soulful tools starts with being brave enough to unlearn.</p>\n<p>üçÅ Heris üçÅ</p>\n</body></html>",

Not in the distant future. But now.</p>\n<p>What would it look like to live like eternal life has already started?</p>\n<p>I've always heard the phrase \"eternal life\" used in spiritual language ‚Äî usually tied to heaven, salvation, or life after death. But I read John 5:24 this morning, and it said something:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It doesn't say \"will have.\"</p>\n<p>It says <strong>has</strong>. Present tense. Already.</p>\n<p>That bothered me a little.</p>\n<p>Because if eternal life is something I already have‚Ä¶ I'm not sure I've been living like it.</p>\n<p>So I went looking, trying to understand. And somewhere in that search, I stumbled across a story I hadn't paid much attention to before.</p>\n<p>His name was Stephen.</p>\n<p>I'd heard of him in passing. But to be honest, I never really sat with his story. This time I did.</p>\n<p>Stephen wasn't an apostle. He wasn't a public figure. He was selected to help distribute food ‚Äî a background role that most people would ignore. But there was something about the way he carried himself. Scripture describes him as \"full of faith, full of the Holy Spirit, full of grace and power.\" Not because he was dramatic, but because he was deeply rooted.</p>\n<p>When conflict arose, he didn't defend himself with panic. He didn't try to protect his image. He just told the truth ‚Äî clearly, calmly, even boldly. It was the kind of clarity that didn't feel like argument. It felt like presence.</p>\n<p>The people watching said his face looked like that of an angel.</p>\n<p>I sat with that detail for a while. Because I knew something:</p>\n<p><strong>You can only look like that ‚Äî calm, radiant, anchored ‚Äî when you're not trying to survive.</strong></p>\n<p>Stephen wasn't bargaining for his life. He wasn't performing. He was living from something deeper. And then this moment happened:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Stephen looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everywhere else in Scripture, Jesus is described as seated at the right hand of the Father. But for Stephen, He stood.</p>\n<p>That's when it hit me.</p>\n<p><strong>Maybe eternal life isn't a reward you get for dying well.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Maybe it's a posture you receive that lets you live well ‚Äî now.</strong></p>\n<p>Stephen wasn't powerful because he was brave.</p>\n<p>He was powerful because he was already alive in a different way.</p>\n<p>That one story showed me more about eternal life than all the theories I'd heard.</p>\n<p>Because it wasn't just about heaven. It was about the way someone could move through suffering, accusation, and even death ‚Äî without being unmade by it.</p>\n<p>And I guess‚Ä¶ that's what I want.</p>\n<p>Not to be dramatic or impressive.</p>\n<p>But to live from the kind of wholeness that doesn't need fear as a motivator.</p>\n<p>To say what's true without needing everyone to agree.</p>\n<p>To serve in small roles without shrinking.</p>\n<p>To forgive even when there's no apology.</p>\n<p>To rest without guilt.</p>\n<p>To glow ‚Äî not for attention, but from presence.</p>\n<p>If that's what eternal life looks like now, I want to live like I already have it.</p>\n<p>So no, I didn't come into this week with an answer.</p>\n<p>Just a question.</p>\n<p>And a story that changed how I see the question.</p>\n<p>Now I'm starting to wonder:</p>\n<p>How much of what I worry about comes from forgetting I'm already alive?</p>\n<p>How many decisions are rooted in survival ‚Äî not sonship?</p>\n<p>Maybe eternal life doesn't start when I die.</p>\n<p>Maybe it started the moment I believed ‚Äî and I've just been invited to finally live like it.</p>\n<p>I don't have conclusions yet. Just a growing sense that I've already crossed over ‚Äî and that life now needs to reflect that.</p>\n<p>Grace and clarity,</p>\n<p>Heris</p>\n</body></html>",

Some are seeking pain ‚Äî not because they enjoy it, but because it's the only way they've learned to feel significant.</p>\n<p>That was me.</p>\n<p>I used to tie my worth to how much I was grinding. If I wasn't pushing past my limits, I feared I wasn't serious enough, hungry enough, worthy enough. Pain felt like proof. Exhaustion became my badge. Even when I wasn't consciously choosing it, I somehow defaulted to it. I wore burnout like a silent trophy.</p>\n<p>But something shifted during my four-month silence.</p>\n<p>No laptop. No code. No content. No output. Just academics, quietness, and a slow erosion of all the performance layers I had built around myself. It felt like failure. But looking back now, that silence wasn't punishment. It was purification.</p>\n<p>In that void, I found Alfred Adler. I found Wallace Wattles. I found out that worth is not tied to how much you suffer. That contribution is more sacred than coping. That social interest is a more powerful goal than self-imposed misery. And that legacy isn't born in wounds ‚Äî it's born in willingness.</p>\n<p>I posted something recently on LinkedIn about this. Not just as content, but as closure. And as covenant.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Legacy isn't built through wounds. It's built through willingness.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Willingness to heal. To grow. To create. To live in joy, not just endure.</p>\n<p>This isn't about rejecting hardship. I still carry responsibilities. I'm doing more than ever. But now I understand: <strong>doing more doesn't mean bleeding more.</strong></p>\n<p>I have to remind myself: I don't owe anyone an explanation for my peace. I don't have to perform exhaustion to prove my importance. I don't need to suffer to feel soulful.</p>\n<p>The reflex to justify my alignment is still there sometimes. I notice it in how I frame my wins. In how I sometimes add a \"but it's still hard\" caveat to joy. That's the old Heris speaking ‚Äî the one who needed pain to feel seen.</p>\n<p>But that version of me has retired.</p>\n<p>And in his place stands a builder. Not building from emptiness, but from clarity. Not working to earn worth, but to express it. Not grinding to be validated, but creating to contribute.</p>\n<p>This is what I now call my <strong>\"post-healing season.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Here are 5 truths I'm anchoring myself to in this new rhythm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Burnout is not a badge. Productivity is not proof. Rhythm is richer than rush.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pain is not purpose. Suffering may shape us, but it should not define us.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Loyalty doesn't mean staying stuck. Disengage from what no longer aligns.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Peace doesn't need a disclaimer. Stop over-explaining your alignment.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Healing is not a brand. Don't get stuck being the guy who \"came back.\" Keep becoming.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is where I now build from: a place of quiet conviction.</p>\n<p>No more pain as posture. No more hustle as identity.</p>\n<p>Just contribution. Just clarity. Just calling.</p>\n<p>If you've been grinding from a place of fear or pain, I hope this reminds you: <strong>you don't need to suffer to matter.</strong></p>\n<p>You are allowed to build from joy.</p>\n<p>You are allowed to be aligned.</p>\n<p>You are allowed to stop bleeding.</p>\n<p>And still create something sacred.</p>\n<p><em>Soul-Coded Heris</em></p>\n</body></html>",

It's a Filter.</em></p>\n<p><em>Inioluwa Badairo üçÅ</em><br>\n<em>June 11, 2025</em></p>\n<p>Two brothers grow up in the same house. Same father. Same pain.</p>\n<p>Their dad was violent, drunk, and absent more than he was ever present.</p>\n<p>Years later, one ends up in prison. The other becomes a therapist. And when asked what shaped their lives, both give the exact same answer:</p>\n<p>\"With a father like mine, what do you expect?\"</p>\n<p>It sounds like they're pointing to the same cause. But they're not.</p>\n<p>One is using the past to justify his pain.</p>\n<p>The other is using the past to fuel his purpose.</p>\n<p>And that right there‚Äîthat split in how they see their past‚Äîis where Adlerian psychology steps in.</p>\n<p><strong>Contrary to popular belief, it's not the past that defines us.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It's the present.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It's who we are now that determines how we remember then.</strong></p>\n<p>This is the essence of Adler's philosophy: the psychology of use. It's not what happened to you that matters most‚Äîit's what you do with it. Your past isn't a chain; it's a material. You can mold it, frame it, assign it meaning‚Äîdepending on the goals and self-concept you carry now.</p>\n<p>Think of memory like this: from the millions of events that happened in your past, your brain doesn't remember everything. It selects. It filters. It edits. But it does this selection based on who you are right now. If your current belief is \"I'm a failure,\" your memory goes hunting for proof. If you carry shame, your memory will serve up stories that keep you ashamed. It stabilizes your mood. It amplifies your identity. Memory, in this sense, becomes not a record of truth, but a mirror for the present self.</p>\n<p>That's why healing doesn't begin with digging up the past‚Äîit begins with facing who you are now. Because until you become satisfied with yourself in the present, you cannot see the past in a new light. If you carry self-hate, you'll interpret even neutral memories as evidence against yourself. But when you begin to respect the person you are becoming, even the darkest parts of your past start to shift in meaning. What once felt like curses begin to look like catalysts. You stop seeing yourself as damaged by the past, and start seeing yourself as someone who used it to grow.</p>\n<p>This is why trauma, for Adler, wasn't something that had automatic power. He argued that it isn't the shock of past experiences that causes present dysfunction‚Äîbut rather the meaning we give them.

I asked him, more than once, to stop saying her name. This wasn't about silencing conversation or policing speech.

They ripple beyond our immediate circle and can shape reputations in ways we don't always foresee.

It said something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The universe wants you to be rich. God wants you to have everything you want, because He can express more of Himself through you when you do.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It sounded inspiring. But I didn't want to accept it just because it felt good. So I started digging, asking questions, and even had some back-and-forth with a friend who helps me think through stuff. Together, we looked into the Bible, psychology, and what really matters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-we-found-in-scripture\">What We Found in Scripture</h2>\n<p>Stories came up about Abraham, Solomon, and Job‚Äîpeople who were blessed with wealth. But their wealth wasn't just for comfort; it came with responsibility and purpose.</p>\n<p>Jesus also warned against greed and said life isn't about having more things.</p>\n<p>So, maybe God blesses sometimes. But it's not about having a lot. It's about who I become and what I do with what I have.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-psychology-helped-me-understand\">What Psychology Helped Me Understand</h2>\n<p>Alfred Adler talked about how people want to grow by being useful to others. It's not just about me getting more. It's about how what I have can help me serve, love, and belong.</p>\n<p>That made sense to me. Wanting more isn't wrong. But it only matters if it helps me become better and help others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-think-now\">What I Think Now</h2>\n<p>Maybe the question isn't, \"Does God want me to be rich?\"</p>\n<p>Maybe it's, \"If I ever am, what would God want me to do with it?\"</p>\n<p>If I have more, I want to carry it well. If I don't, I still want to live fully.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-im-holding-on-to\">What I'm Holding On To</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm meant to grow</li>\n<li>I want to be useful, not just comfortable</li>\n<li>More is only good if it leads to more love and service</li>\n<li>God works through people, and I want to be open to that</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not trying to be flashy. I want to grow steady and deep.</p>\n<p>I'm young, still figuring this out. Still learning how to live in line with what I believe.</p>\n<p>I don't want riches just to say I got them. I want to become someone worthy of whatever comes my way.</p>\n<p>As an Adlerian, I see life as a journey of growth and usefulness. This reflection is part of how I'm learning to live that out‚Äîand I'm glad to share it with anyone who's on the same path.</p>\n<p>Before I close, I want to say this clearly:</p>\n<p><strong>God may desire abundance for me‚Äînot for its own sake, but as a means to express Himself more fully through my life. Abundance is a tool, not a goal‚Äîand true success lies in how I use it to serve, grow, and uplift others.</strong></p>\n<p>This reflection came from reading a book called <em>The Science of Getting Rich</em> by Wallace Wattles. It pushed me to ask bigger questions about faith, purpose, and what it really means to have \"more.\" It's not about chasing wealth for its own sake. It's about what having more allows me to do with who I am.</p>\n</body></html>",

Just the other guy in the background.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Truth is, I haven't switched up my wardrobe in a while. And since we're often seen together, it hit different.

Let it pass.</p>\n<p>Adler says our emotions point to purpose. Even envy wants something. Mine wanted significance ‚Äî not to feel invisible. Not to feel like I was fading next to someone I usually rise with.</p>\n<p>But I'm not led by wounds anymore. I'm led by intention.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-philosophy-talked-me-through-it\">The Philosophy Talked Me Through It</h2>\n<p>Adler's concept of social interest snapped me back.</p>\n<p>The desire to one-up someone?

That is me.</p>\n<p><strong>Their shine doesn't dim my light.</strong><br>\nIt shows that the environment is fertile.

    "html": "<html><head></head><body><p><em>Inioluwa Badairo üçÅ</em><br>\n<em>May 19, 2025</em></p>\n<p>I've been deep in thought lately, piecing together some big ideas that have been swirling in my head. For a while now, I've been soaking up Alfred Adler's and Jim Rohn's philosophies‚ÄîAdler with his focus on living in the moment and courage in the face of life's tasks, and Rohn with his \"you attract success by who you become\" mindset. Those two have been my anchors, shaping how I think about life and movement. They taught me presence and self-discipline.</p>\n<p>Then I stumbled across Wallace Wattles' <em>The Science of Getting Rich</em>, and it threw me for a loop. Wattles comes in hot with this idea that my thoughts can shape my reality, and suddenly, I'm questioning everything I thought I knew.</p>\n<p>At first, it felt like these guys were pulling me in opposite directions. Wattles had me picturing a big future‚Äîlike, close your eyes and see what you want, down to the details. I'd sit there imagining a life with more freedom, more impact, a life that feels true to me. But then Adler's voice would cut through, saying, \"Hey, what about right now? You're missing what's in front of you.\" And Rohn's right there too, going, \"Nice vision, but who are you becoming to make that real?\"</p>\n<p>I was torn. Was I supposed to just think my way to a better life, or actually get up and do something about it?</p>\n<p>I spent a lot of time wrestling with that‚Äîflipping through pages, scribbling in my journal, letting it all simmer. But I'm not someone who stays confused for long. I dig. I reflect. I test. And eventually, it clicked.</p>\n<p><strong>These ideas aren't at odds‚Äîthey're pieces of the same puzzle.</strong> Wattles isn't telling me to daydream until the universe delivers. He's giving me a starting point‚Äîa mental GPS. Adler and Rohn are the ones telling me how to move toward that destination. It's not thoughts or action‚Äîit's both, working together in rhythm.</p>\n<p>Here's how I'm mapping it now:</p>\n<p><strong>Wattles is the dreamer.</strong> He's got me imagining what I want with clarity‚Äîlike a map showing me where I'm headed.</p>\n<p><strong>Adler keeps me grounded.</strong> He reminds me that the real task is in the here and now. That freedom and meaning come from action, not abstraction.</p>\n<p><strong>Rohn is the push.</strong> He's the mirror. \"Are you growing into someone who can handle that vision?\" He's not about hype‚Äîhe's about habits.</p>\n<p>And this isn't just theory for me anymore. I've been wanting to start sharing what I learn‚Äîthrough posts like this, or maybe even a full-on content series. I used to think you had to be some polished writer or expert to put your ideas out there. But Wattles would say: <em>See yourself doing it. Picture yourself typing, publishing, connecting with someone who gets it.</em></p>\n<p>Then Adler cuts in, like, \"Cool. But don't get stuck in the image. Just write one sentence. Show up.\" Rohn? He's watching if I come back tomorrow.</p>\n<p>It's like building a house:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wattles</strong> hands me the blueprint. Without that, I'm just swinging a hammer aimlessly.</li>\n<li><strong>Adler</strong> keeps me focused on the nail I'm hammering right now. Nail by nail, step by step.</li>\n<li><strong>Rohn</strong> checks if I'm building muscle and endurance. The daily reps of becoming.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And here's the real kicker: I'm not just doing this for me. As someone who thinks in systems and sees patterns, I can't help but want to connect these dots for others too. Maybe it's the Adlerian in me‚Äîalways wanting to contribute, to serve. Maybe it's that sense of purpose I've been nurturing quietly, even when I didn't have the words for it.</p>\n<p>I want what I share to feel like a conversation‚Äînot a lecture. I'm not some guru on a hill. I'm a guy figuring it out in real time, dancing between big dreams and grounded actions. And if my process helps even one person feel less alone in their wrestling match between vision and reality, then it's already worth it.</p>\n<p>So no, I don't have to choose between dreaming big and staying present. I don't have to silence one voice to hear another. They're a trio, playing different instruments in the same symphony.</p>\n<p>If you're feeling torn like I was, try this:</p>\n<p><strong>Dream it with Wattles. Do it with Adler. Grow into it with Rohn.</strong></p>\n<p>Don't pick a side. Let them play off each other.</p>\n<p>This is the dance. This is life.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Adler and Rohn were my foundation‚Äîpresent action and personal growth. Wattles came in and added vision. Turns out, they're not contradicting each other‚Äîthey're collaborating. Dream big. Act now. Grow steady. This balance is inspiring me to start sharing what I learn, one post at a time. Let's dance.</p>\n</body></html>",

I could start now ‚Äî building a brand around meaning, mindset, and impact.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-4-gh__heris-is-born\">Chapter 4: GH__Heris is Born</h2>\n<p>I had already chosen my username: GH__Heris or ghheris, depending on the platform.</p>\n<p>But it wasn't random.</p>\n<p><strong>GH</strong> stands for <strong>God's Heritage</strong> ‚Äî the English meaning of my name, Inioluwa, from Yoruba. <strong>Heris</strong> is a stylized form of Heritage.</p>\n<p>So what looked like a simple handle was a declaration: <em>I am God's Heritage</em>. And that would be the foundation of everything I'd build.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-5-building-my-digital-persona\">Chapter 5: Building My Digital Persona</h2>\n<p>With the brand clear, I took action:</p>\n<h3 id=\"twitter-x\">Twitter (X):</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Switched to a creator account, picked a niche ‚Äî writing, mindset, growth.</li>\n<li>Wrote this bio:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God's Heritage.<br>\nAdlerian psychology, Jim Rohn mindset.<br>\nWriting on purpose, growth &amp; social impact.<br>\nMeaning in motion | #GHMindset<br>\nghheris.substack.com</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped a pinned tweet introducing what I'm about.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"substack\">Substack:</h3>\n<p>Created my newsletter, wrote a bio that felt like my voice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm Inioluwa Badairo, aka GH__Heris ‚Äî short for God's Heritage. I write about meaning, mindset, and making an impact. Drawing from Adlerian psychology, personal development, and life in Nigeria, this space is for those who want to grow and give.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"whatsapp-bio\">WhatsApp Bio:</h3>\n<p>Short, powerful:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God's Heritage | Writing on mindset, purpose &amp; impact | Adlerian lens, Naija voice | Read: ghheris.substack.com</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"instagram--facebook-bios\">Instagram &amp; Facebook Bios:</h3>\n<p>Consistent across platforms:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GH__Heris = God's Heritage<br>\nAdlerian psychology | Jim Rohn mindset<br>\nWriting on meaning, mindset &amp; impact<br>\nRead &amp; subscribe: ghheris.substack.com</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-6-looking-back-to-move-forward\">Chapter 6: Looking Back to Move Forward</h2>\n<p>I'm documenting this because I want to remember.</p>\n<p>Remember how it all started.</p>\n<p>How a quote stirred my thoughts. How philosophy and personal development made me want to live for others. How that led to questions, then answers. And how those answers became identity, clarity, and digital action.</p>\n<p><strong>GH__Heris isn't just a brand that I created. It's who I already was ‚Äî I just finally brought it online.</strong></p>\n<p>And this is just the beginning.</p>\n</body></html>",
