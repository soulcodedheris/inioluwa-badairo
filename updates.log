2025-08-16T07:56:33Z | chore: align Tailwind + PostCSS with Angular 20 and fix build
- Dependencies:
  - Removed devDependency: @tailwindcss/postcss
  - Installed devDependencies: tailwindcss@3, postcss@^8, autoprefixer@^10
  - Versions now (package.json): tailwindcss ^3.4.17, postcss ^8.5.6, autoprefixer ^10.4.21
- Config edits:
  - postcss.config.js: use `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` plugins
  - tailwind.config.js: set darkMode to 'class'; removed unsupported `future` field (v3 compatibility)
  - angular.json: disabled production font inlining: configurations.production.optimization.fonts = false
- Build:
  - Confirmed `npm run build` succeeds; output at `dist/portfolio`

2025-08-16T07:58:43Z | feat+improve: website updates & improvements since start
- Layout & navigation:
  - Replaced Angular starter template with custom header, primary nav, and theme toggle in `src/app/app.html`
  - Ensured full-viewport main container and dark mode classes
- Routing & pages:
  - Configured lazy-loaded routes for: home, work (+ case-study dynamic), playground, articles, principles, about, contact (`src/app/app.routes.ts`)
  - Added page components and minimal CSS/HTML for all routes under `src/app/pages/*`
- Theming:
  - Implemented `ThemeService` for dark/light mode with persistence (`src/app/shared/theme.service.ts`)
  - Initialized theme in `App` component and wired toggle handler (`src/app/app.ts`)
- Styling foundation:
  - Set up Tailwind CSS with global layers and base tokens in `src/styles.css`
  - Configured `tailwind.config.js` content paths and darkMode 'class'
- Assets & content:
  - Added brand assets: `public/Heris-Headshot.jpg`, `public/Heris-halfbody.JPG`, `public/soulcodedheris-logo.jpeg`
  - Added `src/assets/articles.json` seed content
- Build & config:
  - Tailwind v3 + PostCSS 8 alignment; added autoprefixer; disabled font inlining in production to avoid external fetch errors
  - Confirmed production build succeeds: `dist/portfolio`

2025-08-16T08:15:45Z | feat+improve: a11y, SEO, routing, data, and performance updates
- Removed legacy inline <style> from `src/app/app.html`; added skip-to-content link; improved nav a11y with aria-current via RouterLinkActive and visible focus rings; added main `id`.
- Fonts: shifted to system stack in `src/styles.css`; re-enabled production font optimization in `angular.json`.
- Hero image: added fetchpriority="high", eager loading, async decoding, and responsive sizes in `home.page.html`.
- SEO: added meta description, Open Graph, Twitter card, and canonical link in `src/index.html`.
- NotFound: added `src/app/pages/not-found/not-found.page.ts`; updated wildcard route to `/not-found`.
- Articles data access: switched to Angular HttpClient and provided it via `app.config.ts`.
- Accessibility: added skip link and enhanced focus states on header nav.
- DX/Consistency: removed empty `src/app/app.css` and dropped styleUrl.
- Public assets: created `public/robots.txt` and `public/sitemap.xml`.
- Build: production build successful with all changes.

2025-08-16T08:48:40Z | feat+content+seo: article rendering with anchors, work items, canonical, and sitemap
- Articles detail:
  - Render full article HTML with anchor-linked heading IDs; Table of Contents links to anchors.
  - Switched detail data source to `/assets/articles.json`; extract TOC from article HTML; inject per-article canonical URL.
- Routing:
  - Added route `articles/:slug` to render individual article pages.
- Content:
  - Added more `WORK_ITEMS` entries in `src/app/pages/work/work.data.ts`.
- SEO:
  - Extended `public/sitemap.xml` with article URLs.
  - Kept canonical in `<head>` and dynamically update it on article detail.

2025-08-16T09:12:45Z | feat+ui+motion: particles.js background, theme sync, and interactions
- Background layer:
  - Added `src/app/shared/particles-background.component.ts` and mounted `<app-particles-background />` in `src/app/app.html` above `<main>` with proper stacking (`z-0` vs `z-10`).
  - Implemented particles.js Default preset with theme-aware colors (light: #111111, dark: #ffffff) and disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is on.
  - Enabled pointer interactions: hover `repulse`, click `push`; detection set to `window` so it reacts across the viewport.
- Library integration:
  - Removed tsParticles and switched to `particles.js` per the official repo [vincentgarreau.com/particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/).
  - Dynamic import with CDN fallback (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/particles.js/2.0.0/particles.min.js`).
  - Added type shim `src/types/particlesjs.d.ts` to declare the module and `window.particlesJS`.
- Theme sync:
  - Added `MutationObserver` to watch `<html class>` and re-init particles on theme toggle (fix: visible in both light and dark modes).
- Layout tweak:
  - Made `<main>` `relative z-10` (removed background fills) so particles remain visible behind content.
- Build:
  - Build passes; Angular warns about CommonJS for `particles.js` which is acceptable.

2025-08-16T09:29:40Z | feat+nav+responsive: mobile header with accessible hamburger menu
- Implemented a mobile-first header that collapses the primary navigation into a hamburger on small screens.
- Menu behavior: focus-trap inside panel, Escape to close, click-away and route-change to dismiss, and body scroll lock while open.
- Accessibility: toggle button uses aria-expanded/aria-controls, menu has aria-label, full keyboard support, and visible focus rings.
- Motion: Tailwind transitions with `prefers-reduced-motion` safe fallbacks.
- Zero extra dependencies; uses Angular and Tailwind only.
