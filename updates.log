## 2025-08-20 - Header/Overlap Fixes, Glass Scroll, and 100dvh Hero

### Visual and Layout Fixes
- **Transparent header at top**; removed solid background, border, and shadow by default
- **Glass/blur on scroll**; header now applies `backdrop-blur`, semi‑transparent background, subtle ring, and shadow when the page is scrolled
- **Raised header z-index** to ensure it always layers above content and particles
- **Removed white horizontal strip** by switching footer top spacing from margin to padding to avoid margin-collapsing
- **Dark-mode body background** set to black so a transparent header doesn’t reveal white

### Home Hero Height
- **Hero fills the viewport**: first section uses `min-h-[calc(100dvh-var(--header-h,0px))]`
- **Dynamic header height CSS variable** `--header-h` set and updated on load/resize in `app.ts`
- **Separated sections**: hero stays full-height; features moved to a following section

### Accessibility/UX
- **Scroll state signal** added; gentle transitions for header state changes
- **Back-to-top visibility** tied to scroll position; remains accessible

### Files Touched
- `src/app/app.html`: header transparency, glass-on-scroll classes, footer spacing, main landmark retained
- `src/app/app.ts`: `scrolled` signal, unified scroll handler, `--header-h` updater
- `src/app/pages/home/home.page.html`: hero min-height and section split
- `src/app/pages/home/home.page.css`: default `--header-h` declaration
- `src/styles.css`: `.dark body` background; minor z-index note for layering

## 2025-08-20 - Planned Improvements (next)

### Accessibility & Forms
- **Add explicit button type** for contact form submit (`type="submit"`) to prevent accidental form behavior

### Performance & CLS Reduction
- **Add intrinsic size** (`width`/`height`) to static images (logo, headshot, hero) to reduce layout shift

### SEO Enhancements
- **Per-route titles and meta** for core pages (Work, Articles list, About, Principles, Contact, Certifications, Playground) via a small meta service hooked to router events

## 2025-08-20 - Playground, Articles, Home spacing, Principles, Footer

### Playground
- **Demo catalog** with tags and chip filters
- **Per-demo pages** at `/playground/:slug` (placeholder content wired)
- **Card links** navigate to the correct demo

### Articles
- **Search + sort** (Newest/Shortest) with live filtering
- **Category chips** with multi-select; clear button
- **Related posts** section on article detail (by category)
- **Copy**: heading anchors and code-block copy buttons

### Home
- **Tighter hero/feature spacing** across breakpoints; removed overlap on tablets
- **Hero micro‑animation** (staggered subtitle/headline)

### Principles
- **Sticky in‑page tab nav** and **fragment anchors** to match Home feature links

### Footer
- **Colophon** (stack/hosting/fonts) and **compact sitemap**

### Contact & Certifications
- **Honeypot** anti‑spam field and success panel
- **Cert thumbnails** now have intrinsic size + lazy/async (reduced CLS)

### Navigation & Performance
- **Route prefetch directive** used on top‑nav links

### Fixes
- **About page buttons**: imported `RouterLink` so CTA links work
