That is the essence of second order thinking. Every action has consequences you see immediately and consequences you only meet later. The first are loud. The second are quiet, but they run deeper.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The average thinker stops at what is visible. The sharper mind asks, &#39;And then what?&#39;&quot; — Frédéric Bastiat</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is the trap. Human nature tilts toward the short term. We chase comfort and avoid effort. Yet the things that shape health, wealth, and character rarely come from what is easy now. They come from choosing friction now so strength compounds later.</p>\n<p>To think in second order terms is more than a clever strategy. It is a discipline, even a moral duty. Live with eyes open to the unseen.</p>\n<h3>First order vs second order</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First order thinking</strong>: linear; one step, one solution; feels good in the moment</li>\n<li><strong>Second order thinking</strong>: systemic; sees ripples, interactions, and compounding effects; endures wisely</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[Image placeholder: ./slides/pages/slide-3.png]</p>\n<p>History is full of first order traps. A government arms a rebel group to topple a regime. The first order result looks clean: problem solved. Zoom out a few years, and the same rebels become a new enemy. Short term gain. Long term chaos.</p>\n<p>Sociologist Robert K. Merton called this blindness the &quot;imperious immediacy of interest&quot;. We want what we want now so much that we ignore what follows, even when the danger is obvious.</p>\n<h3>The simplest tool: &quot;And then what?&quot;</h3>\n<p>It sounds naive, but it cuts through illusions better than complex frameworks.</p>\n<p>This is first principles thinking in practice: break things down to their roots instead of tinkering at the surface. Most people shift blocks around. The first principles thinker dismantles the house, studies the bricks, and rebuilds something new.</p>\n<h3>A quick example: social media</h3>\n<p>First order effect: endless entertainment, quick laughs, a sense of connection. Simple.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Then what: the brain adapts to the dopamine loop; compulsive scrolling</li>\n<li>Then what: anxiety, shorter attention spans, comparison driven depression, a warped sense of reality</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What began as &quot;let me unwind&quot; becomes &quot;my behavior, mood, and worldview are being reshaped without my permission&quot;.</p>\n<p>Every invention solves one problem and, if left unquestioned, creates another.</p>\n<h3>A body example: food and focus</h3>\n<p>Have you noticed how your mind seems to dim after a heavy meal, as if someone pulled the plug on your focus? I blamed sluggish afternoons on discipline, not biology.</p>\n<p>When I overate, my vagus nerve (the bridge between gut and brain) sent its message upward: slow him down, we need energy for digestion. My sharpness dulled, motivation dropped, and hours were lost to mental haze. A harmless first order choice (&quot;enjoy the food&quot;) was taxing my mind, my work, and my purpose. Every plate too heavy was a small tax that added up.</p>\n<h3>A simple playbook</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Decision</li>\n<li>First order consequence</li>\n<li>Second order consequence</li>\n<li>Third order ripple</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pause and map it out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;I scroll for ten minutes.&quot; Then what: lost focus</li>\n<li>Then what: a derailed evening</li>\n<li>Then what: a weaker trust in myself</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Suddenly, the decision is no longer trivial. It is identity on the line in a small act.</p>\n<h3>Closing</h3>\n<p>This is not easy. It takes discipline to say a harder &quot;no&quot; now to protect a better &quot;yes&quot; later. That is the path from being a reactor to becoming a designer.</p>\n<p>Second order thinkers accept short term discomfort as the down payment for long term power. They are not just managing decisions, they are shaping identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Notice what is quiet and choose for your future self.</strong></p>\n"

    "html": "<h3>[Mind] When the Unconscious Meets Infinite Intelligence</h3>\n<p>What if clarity isn’t forced?<br>What if it’s heard?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A word or an image is symbolic when it implies something more than its obvious and immediate meaning.” (Carl Jung, Man and His Symbols)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"./slides/pages/slide-1.png\" alt=\"Slide visual\"></p>\n<p>Symbols carry a “wide” meaning you can feel but never fully define. We make them without trying, especially in dreams. Let me step out for a moment and speak directly to you. Our tools widen the view, but attention is still limited. Most signals stay outside awareness until we invite them in. The rest lands underneath.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Binoculars help you see farther. They do not show what you are not looking at.</li>\n<li>A dream gives you an image while you sleep. The image points beyond itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also resist the unknown. Misoneism (the quiet fear of the new) makes us dismiss what doesn’t fit. So the unconscious speaks in symbols. To guide. To balance. To restore what we overplay.</p>\n<p>Freud and Jung read dreams differently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Freud: repressed wishes; follow associations; uncover conflict.</li>\n<li>Jung: purposeful guidance; study form and symbol; a message in its own language.</li>\n<li>Both can help. Some dreams point to conflict. Others point to what we’re ignoring.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./slides/pages/slide-3.png\" alt=\"Slide visual\"></p>\n<p>About Infinite Intelligence, as Napoleon Hill used the term: think of it as the same receptive channel you meet when you slow down and pay attention. You make room, you listen, and useful guidance shows up. Different language, same practice.</p>\n<p>As I read Jung’s work, I keep one rule in view from Adler: learn from the past, do not live in it. Use what clarifies the next step.</p>\n<p>Quick aside: I rarely remember my dreams (maybe one a month). If that’s you too, you’re fine. We’ll work with whatever signal shows up.</p>\n<p>Here’s a simple way to practice this week.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Catch one symbol</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>On waking, write one image from a dream. One line is enough.  </li>\n<li>If no dream: note one “offbeat” signal from your day: a sentence that stuck, an image you kept seeing, a thought you didn’t want.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Sit with it for five minutes</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe it plainly. No poetry.  </li>\n<li>Ask: What might this be trying to balance? What am I resisting because it’s new? Where am I over controlling?</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Translate to one action</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>If it hints at burden, put one task down.  </li>\n<li>If it points to neglect, give 10 minutes of care to that area.  </li>\n<li>If it invites courage, take the smallest possible step today.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Keep a short evening check</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Read your core goals out loud.  </li>\n<li>Note one clue you noticed.  </li>\n<li>One sentence: “Tomorrow, I’ll test this by ______.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./slides/pages/slide-5.png\" alt=\"Slide visual\"></p>\n<p>A quick decoder you can keep in your notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Function: What is this trying to do for me (warn, balance, encourage)?</li>\n<li>Feeling: What emotion arrives first (not the explanation, just the feeling)?</li>\n<li>Fit: Where in my life does this belong right now?</li>\n<li>Fraction: What’s the smallest 24 hour experiment?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You don’t have to force meaning. Let it gather.<br>It might be a fleeting image.<br>A line you almost skipped.<br>A quiet nudge that keeps returning.</p>\n<p><strong>Notice what you usually ignore.</strong></p>\n<p>Call it your unconscious, call it Infinite Intelligence; the practice is the same: listen.</p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slides (PDF): /articles/unconscious-infinite-intelligence/slides-unconscious-infinite-intelligence.pdf</li>\n<li>Slides (PNG): /articles/unconscious-infinite-intelligence/slides-unconscious-infinite-intelligence.png</li>\n</ul>\n"
